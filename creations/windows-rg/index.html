			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Windows RG</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">"What if Windows RG was real?" was the thought I had when I came up with this idea. After I verified no one attempted to do it before, I began to make it myself.</p>
			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">It's funny to say that you have a VM/PC with Windows RG up and running. That's what this project is for. I made this to make the Internet a favor and not let my Windows knowledge go to waste. That was the first Windows modification I made.</p>
			<h2>How?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">I began by installing vanilla Windows ME to 86box (to minimize driver installations). For programs, I used a VM with Visual Studio 2005 Express and copied the files over to my Windows RG VM via floppy disk images. After a lot of time, all the programs were done.</p>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">Next, I slightly modified Windows to resemble Windows RG more (like modify explorer.exe to display a different Start image, user.exe for error icons and more)</p>			
			<p style="font-family: Times;">Later, I began writing an installation floppy image to load all the drivers and instruct the user on how to do it. I used Norton Ghost to create an image of the drive and also included Partition Magic (That's because of tests I made. They discovered that this program is required to format some drives correctly for Ghost).</p>
