			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Windows 95 RAMdrive</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">Ever wanted to run Windows 95 but you didn't have a hard drive in hand? Wanted to copy files from an old computer? Or just needed to quickly diagnose a computer without writing any files? This CD is just right for you.</p>
			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">I once started a Windows 98 boot floppy and noticed it made a RAMdrive for its tools. I thought to myself: "What if Windows could run inside it?". And this is where the idea started. I created it as a diagnostic tool with Win16/32 base for PCs without a hard drive.</p>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">It allows Windows 95 to run inside a RAMdrive environment. You need a computer with at least 44MB of RAM to run this product. You can use multiple drive sizes (32-256MB), but RAM is always limited to 512MB for compatibility.</p>
			<h2>How?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">I began by installing and patching (for modern hardware) Windows 95 RTM (to save up space) to Virtual PC 2007 in order to minimize driver installations. Then, I moved/deleted as much files as I could to shrink the hard drive space and keep it functional at the same time. For example, I moved programs and color profiles to separate directories on the CD and removed majority of Help files (I still wanted to keep the main Help file).</p>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">Then, I started writing a boot floppy image to start it up. After many errors, I managed to do it. Drivers initialized themselves, Windows copied itself to RAM and started up successfully. I also included an option to load more modern drivers (like SATA and USB CD drivers) for modern computers.</p>
			<p style="font-family: Times;">Next, I added diagnostic tools, programs and games to a folder on my drive that I would use to make a CD drive image. I finished it all with CDBurnerXP.</p>
